# Polling System Backend

A comprehensive polling system built with Nest.js featuring authentication, role-based access control, and real-time voting capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

- **JWT Authentication** - Secure user registration and login
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Admin and User roles with protected routes
- **Poll Management** - Create, edit, delete, and manage polls
- **Public & Private Polls** - Control poll visibility and access
- **Voting System** - Cast votes with duplicate prevention
- **Poll Expiry** - Automatic expiry with configurable duration (max 2 hours)
- **Real-time Results** - View poll results and statistics

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Nest.js, TypeScript
- **Authentication**: JWT, Passport
- **Database**: SQLite (development), TypeORM
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing, class-validator for input validation
- **Testing**: Jest (unit & e2e tests)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd polling-system-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```
### 2. Environment Setup
Create a .env file in the root directory:

env
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-change-in-production

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
DATABASE_NAME=polling.db

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
3. Running the Application
bash
# Development mode (with auto-reload)
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
# Production mode
```bash
npm run start:prod
```
# Build the project
```bash
npm run build
```
The application will start on http://localhost:3000

üóÑÔ∏è Database
The application uses SQLite which requires no additional setup. The database file polling.db will be automatically created in your project root when you first run the application.

GET /auth/profile - Get user profile

POST /auth/logout - Logout

Users (Admin only)
GET /users - Get all users

GET /users/profile - Get user profile

PATCH /users/profile - Update own profile

GET /users/stats/count - User statistics

Polls
POST /polls - Create poll (Admin only)

üß™ API Testing with Postman
Postman Collection
Import the Postman collection from the provided json_polling.json file to test all endpoints.

Testing Sequence
Register users - Create admin and regular user accounts

Login - Get JWT tokens for both users

Create polls - Use admin token to create public and private polls

Vote on polls - Use user token to cast votes

View results - Check poll results and statistics

Test permissions - Verify role-based access control

üß™ Running Tests
bash
# Unit tests
```bash
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Test coverage
npm run test:cov

# Test in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```
üöÄ Deployment
Production Setup
Update .env file:

env
NODE_ENV=production
